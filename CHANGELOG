UPDIAN - UpdateDebian 

Minimalistic Debian Package Upgrade Tool with Web-Frontend by Robert Klikics, RobHost GmbH [rk@robhost.de], 2007-2011


v0.3

- other SSH ports then 22 can be set (hostname:port in server list)
- serverlist, queue and logs are now sorted
- polished (a litte bit^^) interface (table-view and such things)
- if you've installed "debian-goodies" package on remote server updian now checks if 
  running services needed to be restarted after the update process ('checkrestart' is called on the remote machine)
    |_ these services are marked yellow in the "Logs" view
